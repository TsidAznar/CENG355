The infotainment system is an integrated device that connects and communicates with a car’s interface. This device displays all of its data onto a screen acting as the car’s central dashboard. The infotainment system provides a quick and easy way to access information to provide a better experience for the driver and passengers of a car. In addition to this, the infotainment system can also provide forms of entertainment to both the driver and passenger. Our project will utilize the functionality of a canbus system, a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Sense Hat, and a servo motor.
